It's just crazy dude, I don't know where to begin with it, it's so much bullshit, and we talking about the people using it.

Like, should people be paying money to use this app? both female and males, but here is the thing right, like, there is this Japanese app where females don't pay and males pay, like wtf? can't pull the source but that's why my friend right now is working in a company where they are now making a dating app for Japanese. because apparently there is a stigma and somehow the giant Match.com overcame it.

But anyway dude let me go deep.

So the whole problem here right, is just about people. Some people don't put effort, some people are just assholes and some just are there to waste everyone's time, including theirs.

First is the imbalance. Around 70% of users of dating apps are male, the rest is you can guess.

And so this creates so many weird outcomes:
Females get more attention and so they either funnel it to their insta and nothing happens or they just get tired of it, it becomes repetitive and they also have no incentive to swipe, since they aren't looking for anything BECAUSE everything is coming to them... And it comes the same way, match, hi, goodbye, match, hi, goodbye. Like factory worker doing the same thing over and over again.

And males, they get no attention, and the only attention they get is lost because of the females from above, they are spammed, bombarded and have no interest also, everyone is the same to them females, so "unique" males are basically all the same to them.

And the whole human being just few pictures, 500 character bio and prompts, is that truly a way to encapsulate a whole human being, their experiences and stuff?

Oh and another thing texting, it just not a way to get to know someone, texting exist because of the whole trust thing. Because guys are weird and girls have to gain some trust in order to do something. Texting is not how you bond with anyone, that's it, it's for quick information sharing and that's all.

The whole thing really just turns into a nightmare for both parties. And at the end, love stories are lesser and lesser, bad experiences are more common and that's how society is ostracized from one another... is just doomed.

Also one more idea, the corps at 'merica know that, but why should they fix it when their marketing works, they have destroyed third places and this is what they are replacing it so they can profit from it. Capitalism offered a solution to a problem they created, but the problem is that the solution sucks, and nobody has a choice... or nobody isn't solving the problem in a meaningful way...

Everyone meets everyone through 2 places now, school and work.. So if you happen to move from another country, you eat shit if your job sucks. And so you have to go through hoops of bullshit in order to find the right people.

And the whole social media thing. It's a woman's playground, they just need to have the looks, or be ugly but use the filters like it's their identity. And so women are the pictures they share, so they see men the same way, you are the pictures you have on your profile. It's who you are it's what you do, that's it. Women are being programmed to behave and assume things like that are the truth, are a good representation.
