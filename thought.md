can you kill a person with words?

when someone is drunk, and they kill someone in a traffic accident, we blame the driver, not the alcohol company for selling alcohol to that driver, neither the bar
The driver was "under the influence"
And so 
can you technically kill someone with words? Hey go kill yourself and then you do it?
Who is at fault, you who did it or me or said those words?
doesn't seem like me, because at the end you had to still decide and the way you are going to do and and then execute the whole plan.
you were "under the influence" but that's hella strong influence goddamn you snowflake
so no, you can't kill anyone with words.
