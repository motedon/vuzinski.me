I'm going to try to debug this. See where does it come from.
I think one source is that stupid human that I know, sharing bullshit, without paying attention to what I've said. Weirdo.
It's nothing in particular, it's just simply "ignorance is bliss"
And how blissful ignorance is. It's my fault for caring too much.

And the after effect is, loneliness.
