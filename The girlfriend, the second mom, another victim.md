Let's name her AD
I used to meet AD before, she was selling clothes in a Chinese supermarket, I liked her a lot, I was really happy to see her and I think I wanted lots of stuff when I was around her. I remember getting a wristwatch from her.

The father was then preparing to open another restaurant (previous 2 failed) in Tolstoy, Sofia and I don't know what and why but she was gonna help him. 
I remember one day seeing her coming with the father in the apartment in Obelya late at night and they fucked, guess how I knew, guess who went and took a peek through the small holes in the door...

Things kinda went weird from there though

Her family, her mother, adopted guy (let's name him the Cosmos) and her son moved in to live with us. 

And then Mrs AD decided to take my youngest brother away from my mother by travelling 300 km to another province, I remember being there, seeing him for the first time.
He was 3 years old at that time, could say a single word, was pointing at the TV and mumbling like he was retarded, he was very skinny, often sick.

And the red fucking flag I saw was when the mother was making him a drink using Bulgarian yogurt, she put sugar in it...
"Airian" could have a bit of salt but sugar? Never, but she was making it and the little boy was drinking it... fucking weird.

After taking him home, I remember AD really spoiled the shit out of him. That little fuck learned quickly to complain and say things, and so he wanted my stuff, my toys and I said no and then he knows a way to get it, and of course AD now feels like his mom and I was probably some second hand thing, so he got it. I was somewhat possessive of my belongings back then, didn't know sharing, didn't learned that, nobody taught me.

Life was weird in an unpleasant way with those people, they did take care of me, interacted with me, but there was always this tribe mentality, who was with who, and for some reason they really easily got offended by me...?

AD's mother was an interesting character, self proclaimed prophet, can interpret human dreams, had lung cancer but lived with it for a long time using herb medicine and barely any pills and stuff.
