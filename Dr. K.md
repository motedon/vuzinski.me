Watching Dr.K really makes me wanna do things. Or at least try to do something, reach the best version of myself and then whatever happens, try before die.
But is this motivation/inspiration?
If yes, it's gonna be temporary.
Do I still care to do things?
But maybe it's Dr. K a person who I really respect, and here is the problem: That's what I need, a person like him in my life. Male, female, whatever.
People are my inspiration, that's how I work, that's my extroverted curse. I like having the right people around me, it means everything to me. But I don't have, any fucking one.
I tried to find people, but I get shit and shit and assholes and delusional snowflakes and it's tiresome.


Notes from Dr.K
he doesn't want to make us disciplined
he wants to understand the brain and hack it so we are in control.

Some of the things Dr.K is saying here, just start simple small, because we want too much and that overwhelm us, not only that, it sabotages us. We are supposed to study well, earn money, buy house, car, blabla, be smart be handsome, too much.
So here he is saying that we should start small and focus on simple. It's not a bad thing to have more than one goal, but we should focus on one, Daily, daily. And don't let goals pollute each other. 

Also be positive, because the brain is fucking designed to sabotage. It doesn't care about positive, it's always stress, fight or flight, all stress or no stress (doesn't make sense)

Try no matter what to see the positive, despite the negative, try to always balance things out, because biased. Biased towards negativity, biased towards shit

try to notice the positive, don't ignore the negative (it will become toxic positivity). even if it's 9/10 negativity, notice the 1 positive thing.
