Born on the 30th of May 1968.
Who knows what he was like growing up. Grandpa says he was smart, but they were poor, so he had to go to the field and find worms for the ducks to eat.
Somebody said he used to be a police officer, the traffic one, the one that nobody has respect for.
Don't know what happened and how he arrived in Bulgaria and why he stayed but he planned to go to Germany or something.
Don't know how the he met "the mother" and what the in the imaginary god was his pickup line in order to attract her but here we are... And what did she saw in him, but here we are...

I could ask the people from his side to tell his story, but to be honest, it's not worth knowing, I know the important stuff. He isn't human enough to deserve my curiosity

- [ ] the things I remember

# I do remember peaceful times
Going to Vietnam maybe, when I was small, but don't remember much. I remember him buying bicycles for me and my brother, I remember he taking me to the subway parking lot in Obelya to play, I remember he had a big ass video recorder, those which ran on nickel cadmium batteries and you had to carry the whole thing on your shoulder in order to record videos.
He had lots of those cassettes, don't know if he recorded something on all of them, but definitely had some used.
But everything started to go south when the mother left, I remember them arguing about something, I remember she eating a slap and falling to the ground sound and then it was over. 
But I also remember I had my other brother being born and me playing with him while he was on the baby bed. And so when things went south, she took the baby and left, never to be seen again.

Oh and they never married in the traditional way, so no divorce. Nothing was lost, nothing was taken, nothing was given. The family unit was nonexistent.

# The violence was there
I do remember even before the mother left, when he hits, its very painful, slippers, hands, broomsticks, cables...

For any reason that is not exactly worth of causing so much pain, I got pain.

And here is the kicker, the more I cried OR IF I cried, he will continue, so I had to just take and just shut it, hoping it will gonna be short...it will end soon...

The sad thing is that I learned violence from him. I did the same to my brother, if not worse... It's one of the regret I have to live with.

I did apologize, sincerely, I wanted to do so because it felt heavy, the regret, I wanted to do something... Well at the end I did take care of him for almost 2 years, gave him a king's life and despite we arguing and he being what he think he is, we went on different paths, no regrets, the debt was paid.
I don't want to think about him ever again. #Why

Through out my entire existence in Bulgaria
I remember only 1 birthday
and only 1 holiday, new years eve.
I do remember him taking the box of toys and throwing it away, because he was angry for some reason.

# The algorithm of anger
S-Son
tf-the father
1. S: *says something, asking for something*
2. tf: says "A" he didn't fucking hear
3. S: repeats the same thing
4. tf: the yelling starts
5. S: *silence and the regret of even trying.*
Occasionally there will be violence, depends on what S said

Never was it any different, always the same. There is a video on my Facebook where my brother imitates him, same vibe, same words, same accent. It was funny because of the accuracy, but someone's comedy is another one's reality/tragedy...

Now let me tell you about the worst year of my life and how painful hopelessness felt like.
