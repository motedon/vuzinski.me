when someone is drunk, and they kill someone in a traffic accident, we blame the driver, not the alcohol company for selling alcohol to that driver, neither the bar/restaurant/pub/convenient store

The driver was "under the influence"

And so 

can you technically kill someone with words? Hey go kill yourself and then you do it?
Who is at fault, you who did it or me or said those words?

doesn't seem like me, because at the end you had to still decide and the way you are going to do and and then execute the whole plan.

you were "under the influence" but that's one hella strong influence goddamn you snowflake
so no, you can't kill anyone with words.

You can make someone believe what you say is the truth.

"You're useless"
"You're worthless"
"The world will be a better place without you"

But this the same as being under the influence, those statements are subjective, they could be the truth but they also could not be.

But again, you are "under the influence" and so you're basically given the power of the "influencer", whatchu gonna do with it bud?
or you got influenced by an influencer, oh you little sheep, you're still at fault, because you should be capable of being rational, LOL...

Don't blame the influencers, blame the influenced. indeed, indeed.
