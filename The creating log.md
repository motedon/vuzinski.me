I finally managed to create cool features in this blog, it took some time to learn and I did ask questions but nobody answered, too busy, thank god for my genius.
I didn't knew anything about the plugins, and how to code the functionality I wanted.
I did have an example from Joshua's page:
https://notes.joschua.io/

I did ask him long time ago how he implemented those features and he did show me one of his posts, but it was outdated and it was for obsidian publish, not for Quartz:

I also had to figure out how to add the extra functionality to his code snippet to remove the index page from being shown, along with recent new and recently edited.

I had to look it up and figure it out using the "dataview" documentation
https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/queries/query-types/

I didn't know how to use the "templater" plugin also, where to put the code and how to run it, this was helpful:

I also learned to open the obsidian command with ctrl + o and then if I type something that isn't a command, it's gonna create a new note with that name on it... very handy! while disappointed I just learned it a bit too late.

templater documentation:
https://silentvoid13.github.io/Templater/introduction.html

The "recently edited" and "Recent new files" is basically a hack. So I learned that it could be done using the templater and dataview plugin, here are some sources:
https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/issues/334
https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview/issues/42

It was a really fun tinkering and trying to figure things out. And I'm glad at the end I made it work just the way I wanted. Cool stuff.

I just finished another feature, don't show on those recent tables posts that are marked as draft... I'm enjoying this a lot. Thanks Joshua for giving me the blueprint so I can figure out the rest.

And now what is left is to find out can this thing handle images and can it handle them well

But it's time to celebrate and relax for a bit.
