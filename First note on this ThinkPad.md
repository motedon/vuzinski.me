I'm going to write a lot of shit on this ThinkPad but the keyboard is a bit wonky so that needs time to getting used to, I do want to write fast and I do want to do everything here.

Maybe just transfer my quartz and blog folder here and be done with it.

ThinkPad bought on the 29th of August 2024
64GB RAM, 1TB sk hynix SSD, AMD cpu with 8 cores 16 threads, nice built-in GPU, better than my gtx1050ti. Doesn't have Windows 11 key baked in the BIOS... love this shit.
Costed me shit ton of money but I will use this for sure and a lot.
Light, has type-c charging, I can plug in 100W powerbank and it can last shit ton.
And it's running linux. KDE neon
It's truly MY PC

I have to set up some OneDrive bullshit to back up things I create here. So if linux goes kaput, I will be fine. I wanna install some VM's windows 10 one, Kali, and have fun.
