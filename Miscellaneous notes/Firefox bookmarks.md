Googling and understanding Anhedonia
What is anhedonia? Anhedonia is the **lack of interest, enjoyment or pleasure from life's experiences**. You may not want to spend time with others or do activities that previously made you happy. Anhedonia is a common symptom of many mental health conditions. It's normal when your interests change throughout your life.
