You know, you have a lot, friends, family, truly a lot. And so, when you fall, you have at least a safe net/pillow to fall on, It's called a support circle. 

I donâ€™t want to compare and stuff, so I just want to say, when I fall, I fall hard, I hurt myself badly. I have nothing, no one, nobody, nothing to stand on, no net, no support, nothing.

Tomorrow I die, 10 days later my name is forgotten. Not 10 weeks, not 1 year, not 10 years. No parent will cry, no body will attend, I might be just there in the morgue.
