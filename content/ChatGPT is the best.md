Just checking if ChatGPT solved a problem I had that took me hours looking at a stupid documentation but the solution is just in the programming language itself.

# It is a very good find tool
Using a tool like ChatGPT is very useful when google is shit when trying to find a particular how to or have a particular scenario that is difficult to find out there using traditional search engines.

# It is a very good learning tool
Trying to grasp a concept using traditional search engines is tiresome. You have to to first find the sources and then read read and read to see what's the common theme. But not to mention how looking for that content in the first place, trying to filter out the trash SEO spam ads infested public toilet sites, is tiresome and mentally draining.
Having GPT explain it in all in simple words, with the options of asking for example or go into a particular detail is truly Personal-Tutor level shit, incredible.

# saves you time
Guess how

# But...
1. It doesn't do the learning for you
At the end of the day, you have to be the one who writes the code, it can do it for you, sure but guess how much you learn from that.

2. It's not free
It requires so much computing power and electricity. Overall the infrastructure is HUGE and it can't be free.
But pay 20 bucks for ad free google or 20 bucks for a personalized tutor that can save you time, which one you think its better?

# Those Wallstreet idiots
They write how it's gonna cost a lot to have this nice tech but it won't make them profits...
And so they call it over-hyped?
It did deserve the hype, but marketing ruins everything, doesn't it? fake promises, useless sci-fi predictions.

# At the end
The Minimal Subscription Setup for education will be like this:
1. YouTube, So you don't see another garbage ad, and the content there is useful. Also Visual and Auditory 
2. LLM's - The best one out there so that you have access to the latest model with the latest training data.
