Oh  
# Put your loving hand out, baby 
# I'm beggin'

Beggin', beggin' you
Put your loving hand out, baby  
Beggin', beggin' you  
Put your loving hand out, darling

Riding high, when I was king  
Played it hard and fast, 'cause I had everything  
Walked away, wonderin' then
But easy come and easy go  
And it would end

So ah, any time I need ya, let me go  
Every time I reach, you get me low  
Every time I seek, you let me know  
But I planted that seed, just let me grow  
I'm on my knees while I'm (beggin')  
# 'Cause I don't wanna lose (you)  
# I got my arms all spread  
# I hope that my heart gets fed  
# Matter of fact, girl, I'm beggin' (beggin', beggin')

Beggin', beggin' you  
Put your loving hand out, baby  
Beggin', beggin' you  
Put your loving hand out, darling

# ==I need you to understand  
# Tried so hard to be your man  
# The kind of man you want in the end  
# Only then can I begin to live again ==

An empty shell I used to be  
Shadow of my life was hangin' over me  
A broken man that I don't know
Won't even stand the devil's chance to win my soul

What we doing? What we chasing?  
Why the bottom? Why the basement?  
Why we got good shit, don't embrace it?  
# Why the feel for the need to replace me?  
# You're on a runway track from the good  
# I wanna paint in a picture telling where we could be at  
Like the heart ain't attached where it should  
# You done give it away, I had it 'til you took it back  
But I keep walking on, keep opening doors  
Keep hoping for that the call is yours  
Keep hoes on hold  
# 'Cause I don't wanna live in a broken home  
# Girl, I'm beggin' (beggin', beggin')

Beggin', beggin' you  
Put your loving hand out, baby  
Beggin', beggin' you  
Put your loving hand out, darling

# ==I'm fighting hard (yeah)  
# To hold my own (hold my own)  
# Just can't make it  
# All alone (all alone)==

I'm holding on (yeah)  
Can't fall back (no, I'm fallin')  
I'm just a con (yeah)  
'Bout to fade to black

Beggin', beggin' you  
Put your loving hand out, baby  
Beggin', beggin' you  
Put your loving hand out, darling

Beggin', beggin' you  
Put your loving hand out, baby  
Beggin', beggin' you  
Put your loving hand out, darling

This song really illustrates me and the things that happened and how I feel.

oh and somehow I feel like I'm over the bad events with MT. I'm easy to find if I'm needed. I know I'm not and won't be, but it doesn't matter. We continue marching, until we can't.
Have a good life, I just hope you get the same treatment as me so you might understand what is it like.
You know what they say about karma, right, she a bishhhhh.
