## How do you know when you are actually over someone?
If you have a picture of them, look at them and notice your reactions and feelings.
If you feel sad/angry or/and want to do something that involves that person, then obviously the fire hasn't burned out completely. There is still residue, there are triggers, etc.
Also the memories triggered after seeing a picture or even just reminding yourself of those memories.

But for some reason today I did that, not only that, I just did it again. Reminded myself of her and our memories and... nothing, "whatever" my mind said.

How long, like 2 months? That's good. Speed-running the "like-someone-and-get-the-asshole-treatment".

Might just say that she is an asshole, has issues, blabla, whatever, good memories worth nothing to me anymore, so might just call them events. Nobody is going to remember the good things when at the end when closure is needed, an asshole attitude is showed. Be more mature, talk it through.

I guess not having enough time to develop your culture has resulted not only in men not being able to communicate, but also women.

I barely have dreams when I sleep. But today I had one and it's a weird one, but a comfortable one also.

My childhood crush, Alex, we were cuddling, well, not exactly, laying next to each other and her legs were over mine.
After seemingly a decent amount of interaction, the feeling of that scene in the dream is comfort, comfortable with that person. And she suddenly looks at me and says: "I want to marry you". And then she said something weird related to farts afterwards which I didn't hear, even in my dream and IT WAS TIME TO WAKE UP FOR FUCK SAKE.

Weird dream, but I'm glad I remember the feeling of it. Comfort. No matter the life situation, to be comforted, so that it is doable, it's less overwhelming and it's ONE very important reason to continue.
