I have no idea what to write how to write.
I can only vent out my frustrations since I have no one to do that with.
I don't care if I have a big wiki or not, and I can enjoy my graphs here, I can make a whole setup here, offline, rather than an online setup.
I just find it weird, meaningless. I barely read nowadays too...

I binge watched twitch yesterday, I felt pretty burned out from my shitty work.
I don't learn and don't do anything worth writing about, I believe so.
I don't use social media and I do like sharing stuff, And so I might do it here instead of those places.
It's just one layer deep, but still anyone can see it, does that make it bad?
