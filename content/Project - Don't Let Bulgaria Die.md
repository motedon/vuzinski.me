I saw recently that Bulgaria is losing it's population kind off rapidly.
When I was there the number was 8 million +-, now it's 6 and going down. I don't know why but I'm not enjoying that. I'm not a patriot but Bulgaria is worth having and that place should be flourishing.

And so what I'm trying to do here is to preserve some of it, through my memories and through a wiki of language, grammar, food, bits of history and content on the web, YouTube channels, Reddit stuff.

Despite me being raised like shit by my deranged parents
Bulgaria is beautiful.
Bulgarian language is beautiful.
It's my birthplace.
