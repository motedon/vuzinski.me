Who knows, but it went from cheesy to cringe in a very short amount of time.
Go breed you conflict avoidant one, go breed.
Your performance is so shit that it just shows how much basic of mistakes you make.
And then ooohh, miscommunication, lol, avoid more pls.
Happy breeding useless one, happy breeding, wish you eternal suffering so you can learn some OG compassion and humility, meh, low-grade sub-human.

How ironic, I tell you to learn some compassion while I have none for you, right?
There are plenty of assholes, trust me, no compassion for people who don't understand what they are doing while not realizing what they are actually doing and are not willing to question "if it is actually true".

"I don't have to answer this"
"You are not my friend"
miscommunication my ass. I fart better than your life goals.

As I said in the previous posts, I am not a saint, might be the biggest asshole out there, unconfirmed, but here is the core, because most are too blind or stupid to see it: "I don't enjoy being one"
I can be one, but I don't enjoy being one. It solves nothing, helps nobody, improves nothing. But some just ask for it, or have nothing to else to show except that.
