# "Helping society" by flexing STEM 
Apparently "masters in psychology & neuroscience. human nature is fascinating | epigenetics research" are doing onlyfans now. 

Wao

Time researching is time spent streaming: https://www.twitch.tv/mira

You lose what you don't practice, in this case, the brain, the thing that onlyfans girl got the masters from. I, for some reason highly doubt she has any papers, just wanna get "smart" onlyfan payers... It's just cringy and so out of this world but this is the reality we live in...

Never heard the guy who saved people, built houses, run nuclear power plants flexing on Threads? Ch√©m gi√≥ th√¨ gi·ªèi, nh∆∞ng m√† lo·∫°i nh√¢n v·∫≠t ƒë·∫•y th·ª´a r·ªìi c·∫≠u.

Well, isn't that the easiest thing to do, label them this and that and then feel great about ourselves since our labeling feels so good when it's accurate...?

I'm compassionate, those people lack a quality companion, lack something really important and so it manifests in this parasocial, one way relationship.

Males nowadays feel lonely and so they are looking for a companionship, it of course could be represented as hookups, but I'm somewhat certain that companionship is what will fill the void, rather than friction games.

Narcissism and ego boosting aside, we humans are social creatures. And the fact that social media doesn't help or doesn't do anything regarding ACTUAL SOCIALIZING just adds so much shit onto the already smelly pile of issues.

It's unfortunate that we treat each other like we are just a picture with 3 options: like, express fake meaningless opinion and "trash talk with someone else"

Shall we call the 99% of men giving her attention(who basically make onlyfans a viable business) "incels"?
# Threads, the cringy version of LinkedIn
Not to mention those cringy 25 year old on Threads flexing their fake achievements but Vietnamese are not stupid dude, rock solid, here, look:

> X√£ h·ªôi VN m√† nh∆∞ Threads th√¨ ch·∫Øc gi·ªù s√°nh ngang hay th·∫≠m ch√≠ gi√†u h∆°n Singapore üêß
> 	Wakanda c·ªßa Ch√¢u √Å

> CƒÉn b·∫£n l√† ng∆∞·ªùi m√† ph·∫£i c√†y cu·ªëc b·∫±ng x∆∞∆°ng m√°u th√¨ kh√¥ng ai l√™n m·∫°ng x√£ h·ªôi khoe ƒë√¢u.

Some might say: OOHOHOHOHOH reddit is for losers
To that: tell me those comments aren't the truth. What do fake achievers actually achieve? Internet points helps who exactly? Does Wakanda actually run on flexing on Threads?

# Also Karens exist?
but what? we say to them "you go girl" ?
and call the guys incels? and simps?

You cunts have stopped:
1. asking questions
2. being compassionate
And started:
1. receiving so much attention for so little effort.
2. demanding more and doing less

He can take a picture and it costs nothing.
She can take a picture and it can cost 5 bucks.
You guys don't deserve shit until you fucking stop making onlyfans a viable income stream. It's two sided issue

AND THE SOLUTION BEGINS WITH THE GENDER THAT SETS THE EXAMPLE...
