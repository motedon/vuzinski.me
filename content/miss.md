I miss interacting with you HTMT. I know things won't get better, I know it's over forever. Can't help but like you, can't help having a special place in my heart for you. There is no point in bothering you, have a good life. Can't help but feel things while thinking about us. You know where to find me, if ever.
Anyway, have fun.
