- [ ] Make an icon image for the blog
- [ ] Make the language notes
- [ ] Create the whole catalog page using the TP script
- [ ] Link the whole catalog somehow (doesn't need to be shown like the "recents")
- [ ] Clean the firefox tabs from ChonkyPad PC
- [ ] Interesting posts on the other vault worth putting here?
- [x] Delete the backup vault 
- [ ] Update the index page
- [ ] WRITE MORE.
- [ ] MAKE THE ACCENT COLOR OF THE WEBPAGE PURPLE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

An idea that is why this whole space on the internet is:
1st write about oneself, connect the dots
and then
explore the universe since I don't have to ever talk about myself ever again, since I fucking wrote it, clearly and with all the important details. 
hopefully it feels lighter so new things can get it, change might happen

I want to try to dissect myself here as much as possible, to see how the graph looks like. and then we move on to the next project
Project N1 - Thyself. lets begin/continue.
