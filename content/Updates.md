Personal or technical updates worth pointing out.
## Technical Updates:
##### **26.09.2024 21:10**
This page now has a domain name, vuzinksi.me, very fucking cool if you ask me.
Also soon testing for images will be done, so that more expression is allowed AKA MEMES.
200k một domain, haha ngon. tính 1 bát phở là 35k thì tầm 5 bát phở đc có blog cá nhân. Hoặc nếu tính bằng giá xăng thì nó sẽ hơi đắt, 20k/lít thì 10 lít xăng đc blog cá nhân, đẩy bình cho 5 xe wave.

The "Recently edited" and "Recent new files" Tables now work. Clicking each link won't show 404 page.
Thanks to ChatGPT... I did manage to figure out how to find the files and how to modify or change something in them using the Templater or Dataview pluggins in Obsidian, mind you, I have no experience with JavaScript despite it being used in the Templater script...
An one liner that fixed it all...
```
queryOutput.value = queryOutput.value.replaceAll("content/", "");
```
And now the date is the right format in one of the tables.

I'm starting to see blue fog/smoke while looking at a light source, going blind?
