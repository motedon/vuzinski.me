I don't have celebrity crushes or that kind of shit, like Henry Cavill is handsome, Scarlet Johansson is not bad, Anne Hathaway is... wow..., Ryan Reynolds is charismatic but goddamn Selena Gomez in her thirties is a goddamn baddie and that's something important to write down. I did try to text her but she told me to "calm down" in a [very creative way](https://youtu.be/WcIcVapfqXw?si=VxIBpxLuscTOoavR)

I guess no more badminton then. You talked the talk, very charming, different even, but at the end you didn't walk the walk. But I don't blame you, you have my respects. Wish you well. Remember, nobody is 100% busy, it's all about priorities and decency.

I do not understand why such a hot place like Hanoi can have so much snowflaky personalities. Harsh environments create strong people but I guess AC has spoiled most, if not all.

real people with real lives have no time to make it glamorous on social media, no matter the achievements. Cheers to those who know what is it actually to be alive and to live.

“Don’t walk behind me; I may not lead. Don’t walk in front of me; I may not follow. Just walk beside me and be my friend.”

Simple request: If you have not ever asked me a question about myself or my life, don’t talk behind my back like you know me. I work in the same place as you, interact with the same people as you, it doesn’t mean you know me better than my mom (even she doesn’t). Applies to everyone, it’s just a matter of simple respect. Life is already difficult enough, let’s not make it more difficult for each other.
