some people, like me, have experienced really bad stuff.

and what we usually do is to try to fix those bad stuff, or reject them, or get rid of them somehow.

The regrets of the things we didn't have, the things we could have had and the most delusional one: the things we "deserved"

but the more we try to remedy our past, the heavier and more important those things get in our head, why? because they aren't solvable, you can't get rid of them and you can't deny that they didn't happen.

also the regrets of the things we didn't have, the things we could have had and the most delusional one: the things we "deserved"

but the more we do those things, the heavier and more important those things get in our head, why? because they aren't solvable, you can't get rid of them and you can't deny that they didn't happen.

and the cycle continues, but it slowly spreads wider and wider,  become more and more of who we are. We turn into a victim, we start to hate the world for seemingly not even caring about our scars.

important part here is also "the victim". Oh this happened to me, so bad, so sad, I deserved better, I wish it could be better, I regret a lot.

aren't you bored of saying this?

saying the same shit for X amount of years and nothing has changed? that's boring, meaningless to say the least because nothing is solved, nothing has changed.

not only boring, it's repetitive and tiresome.

very tiresome, you scream like a victim and nothing happens, again and again.

you've heard the phrase," let it go" and the concept of "acceptance ".

but let me tell why you should do those things.

not should, but have to, logically

because fundamentally, right now or tomorrow you can still do the things you like, you can still experience new stuff. Fundamentally, nothing right now is stopping you from having some fun. Those thoughts can't PHYSICALLY restrict you, there is no real cage you are in right now

the things you feel, regrets and sadness, the things you've experienced, the bad and terrible have no power over today or tomorrow. Or they could have no significant influence on your freedom of actions today and tomorrow.
And it's not about diminishing the things that happened and the feelings you're feeling because of them.

but here is the thing, you can't do 2 things at once.

you can't dwell and enjoy today at the same time.

so you have to make a choice ( see, you are even free to make a choice today).

it's your choice to let go of the wish that it didn't happen.
And the feelings, to accept what happened to you as "it just happened", to accept that they are part of you and you're going to live with those memories for the rest of your life.

Or to continue the self-pity?
which one will it be?

living life is not about dwelling on those things, in fact you are not living at all, just existing.

when you let go and accept, you become lighter, you become alive. And life provokes actions aka the things you enjoy doing.
The constant dwelling into our misfortunes, the obsessiveness with which we wish it didn't happened alters how we see the world, how we feel about it too but not in a good way.
We turn into a victim, we start to hate the world for seemingly not even caring about our scars, for allowing such people to exist or events to happen in the first place

The important part here is "the victim". Oh this happened to me, so bad, so sad, I deserved better, I wish it could be better, I regret a lot.

aren't you bored of saying this? Aren't you bored of being in this cycle?

saying the same shit for 25 years and nothing has changed? bruh that's boring

And life provokes action and so one of those actions could be one of the things you enjoy doing.
