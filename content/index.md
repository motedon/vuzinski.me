title: Welcome to Vuzinski's Dossier
---
Hello, this is my first **something**. 
Open-sourcing my brain?
Definitely not a chick magnet.

A human, trying to find “the beauty of life”, trying to “make good things happen” despite the absolute bullshit around, past, present and future.

## Why "Dossier"?
noun: **dossier**; plural noun: **dossiers**

1. a collection of documents about a particular person, event, or subject.

includes the **good**, the **bad** and the **ugly**.
Really tired of judgmental people who just care about the "good". 
Look beyond or deeper, you are not supposed to be shallow.

Explore with curiosity. Read for entertainment.

## Why public?

1. Improve my **thinking process**.
2. Improve my **writing**.
3. Try be more **articulate**.
4. Self-debugging
5. The feeling of having created something
