dude, it's the best thing.
I started with KDE neon it had the newer kernel than Debian and it had the latest KDE plasma desktop

But there were some annoying things, it was running pulseaudio and not pipewire, I changed it to pipewire but OBS still didn't work because it wasn't actually the latest pipewire, I had to download and build it myself.
And for some reason, I wanted to try the newest kernel and stuff, maybe it's more optimized for my PC and stuff.
One thing I noticed was the PC gets somewhat hot for not even doing anything, when idling it could reach 57 degrees which is weird but I it was my first OS on the ThinkPad so it might be a cooling issue. And the battery drained super fast for a brand new thinkpad.

Dude, and Arch Linux fucking fixes everything, it was easy to install, I had to reinstall it so that my home and root folders are not two separate partitions, and then the whole setup process, really cool.
I mean I'm lucky to have the hardware, I don't have nvidia bullshit, everything works fine. And the battery life is comparable to windows. With windows I could have had more features like the fingerprint but I don't have a license so who knows if its gonna be updated. I could run any windows I want actually, without the bullshit.
But I prefer to QEMU everything, kali, windows (of course debloated) that's why I have so much ram and powerful CPU
