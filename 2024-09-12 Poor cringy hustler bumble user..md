Just got unmatched from a person from bumble who is so much into hustling, that become a judgmental asshole without even asking the right question.
Thinks I'm talk more than I do.
Thinks her advice is going to help me right away, just start she says... It's not that fucking simple isn't it.
Probably got offended because I told her her advice applies only for her and it has worked for her, but that doesn't mean it will work for everyone.
Just do it she says, that's why gym memberships increase after new years eve and decrease rapidly after the 1st week.

Hasn't asked anything about personal life, just wants to know if I'm a gym rat or not... dude, relax.

I asked her out and she didn't fucking text when it was time, came home and took a nap, lol and then I'm the talker and not the doer, you can't even keep a meeting up... 

Man, some people are really cringy, they forget most of the important stuff and focus on judging, fucking cringe.

Thinks it's just easy to do things, build a rocket then, fucking cringy bumble user.

You won't find anything, just fuck off, hope you suffer more to see what's life all about.

The problem with life and people is this:
If I get smashed by truck tomorrow or just simply drop dead, I still win, I won't be here to experience your bullshit, I win.
But If I win win, then you lose and that's all. Either way, I'm fine that should be a guarantee.
But here is the thing...
What happens during the period of me not dead and trying to win?
It's a question I don't have an answer to. I should, but I don't.
