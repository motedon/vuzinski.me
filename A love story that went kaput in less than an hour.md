# The beginning, where? how?

Around 8-9 of July 2024 we matched on Bumble. We started texting and at first it wasn’t anything unique. One thing that was noteworthy was that she was always there, the conversation isn’t like one texts and the other is replying 2 hours later and vice versa. It was a conversation lead by 2 people at the same time. Later on, the same date, I think late in the evening, she started sending voice messages. She likes to talk about the things that happened during her day and at that time it was her friends having a romantic interest on a guy and blabla bla you know, the cheesy stuff.

And here comes the cool stuff.

I went on the roof of my apartment building and we called through Bumble. Initially it was going to be about me talking how a specific car company was going to fail because of X amount of reasons(it was late, she was interested to hear me share that and we said we gonna go to bed afterwards) but the conversation went far after that, we talked I think up until 3AM in the morning. Talked about psychology, about relationships about this and that.

The unique thing about it was that I wasn’t bored at all, usually I’m the one who fuels the conversation, but it was so comfortable, I didn’t worry about it. It was smooth and both of us were very interested in talking to each other.

Our first conversation ended because my phone battery died…

# Interaction, calls, texting

We continued texting through Bumble the next day and of course we did wanted to talk. I noticed then that Bumble uses the camera even when voice calling, my phone was heating up because of that and battery drained faster and not to mention the whole privacy issue. I told her that and on the 10th of July at 21:10, we messaged each other on Instagram and called right away. One thing I remember was that we talked about her previous meetups with guys from Bumble, we were doing a case study analysis of each person and there was one specific person we talked about the most because he was into doing weird shit, revenge cheating, etc. We tried to analyze “the psyche” of that person and it was fun not because we were gossiping, it was just fun trying to understand things and have a chill discussion. Other than that, I talked about my core live beliefs and stuff.

The call ended at 1:27 in the morning.

### last phone calls + texting before meetings.

11th of July 2024 We texted at lunch the next day. One thing she asked me was: She: Can I follow you? Me: Can I follow you? She: Okay, you answer me Me: there is no “forbidden” sign, be my guest She: I’m afraid I will be kicked out (me canceling the follow) Me: I hope I won’t.

The irony is that she was the one who kicked me out (juicy details bellow) and blocked me too (juicy details bellow).

Didn’t called that day.

12th of July I wished her a good day and she told me that she went late to work because her cat SHAT on her bed and how some she broke some furniture while using it. Again, she likes to talk about things that happened to her.

I did notice while we were talking about her previous experiences that she is somewhat sensitive. She is quite shy to the point of “uncomfortable asking for a cup of water”. Also she did say she would like to talk to a guy for at least 3 times through the phone to see or at least feel safe to meet. And so I asked her if she wanted to meet, and I made sure she knows we talked only 2 times and she can deny, until she feels comfortable.

We had a phone call from 20:37 till 22:18. My friend texted me to meet and so I told her I was going to meet him. When I was done with meeting my friend at 23:36, I texted her back, we did say we are going to call again, but it seems like, she has fallen asleep. And then at midnight, she wakes up and texts me back, wanting to talk, I’m like: “Are you sure?” and she was like: “Yeah” But that “yeah” was like so easy, like she really wanted that, she wasn’t doing it for me. And so we talked from 00:40 till 4:06 in the morning… knowing we had to work “the next day”, imagine that…

# Meetings

### 1. 13.07.2024

We met. I went to her alley, picked her up and we went to our first coffee shop (don’t remember the name or location) We wanted to sit somewhere less crowdy so we went upstairs, but it become too hot and we didn’t have a fan. We moved a lot, 4-5 seats and location in less than 20 mins, looking for the perfect spot. We talked, she shared some interesting stuff about her work, how she designed a really nice “mental health” foldable leaflet.

And soon, I make my first mistake, and I fix it, like a firefighter extinguishing a fire.

#### mistake - never talk about your previous dates to a girl, ever.

I do not know exactly where it started, but I said something like: “throughout all the X people I’ve met, there was only one where I “fell in love at first sight”.”

It wasn’t a special story for me, the chick I met back them ghosted me the moment she went home that evening so, nothing really out of ordinary for me. I went over it, never contacted or did anything weird.

But here is how she(my current date) reacted and what she said: She said she liked me… She also said we shouldn’t meet ever again… I’m like, why? and she goes like: Because the way you talked about her, seems like you like her, even now… I’m like: Oh my gosh no, it was long time ago, its nothing now, I’m just sharing.

Basically I felt I was misunderstood while also making a the mistake of sharing anything regarding my past dating stories.

I was calm, so I tried to calm her down: relax, you misunderstood me, just relax okay, she doesn’t matter now, okay, I’m sorry. (approximate recollection of memory)

She did eventually calm down, fire extinguished…

We went to eat at a really nice Korean restaurant, tried some really nice food while also bringing home some left overs, which I ate the same day.

I think after that we had a very long conversation at công viên Thông Nhất. Walked till we found a bench. Sat and talked. Up until quite late.

We went home, texted each other the days afterwards, nothing bad had happened.

“And they lived happily ever after” - yeah I fucking wish…

### 2. 17.07.2024 Birthday boy

So after our first meeting on the 13th, we texted each other daily, it was fun. One of the days before 17th of July, she asked me if I want to celebrate my birthday with her (On Wednesday), I was hesitant at first, but later I agreed.

I came to pick her up at 19:02. It was a rainy day but that didn’t stop us. We went to a bánh mì chảo place, it was good. After that we went looking for blueberries, I’ve never tried them so I wanted to see how it tastes like and I was joking at that time that it will increase my IQ. After we found some highly expensive imported blueberries, we went to a really nice unique coffee shop: Nhà Kho. It was designed with Vietnamese history in mind, it had old TV’s, typewriters, it had old Soviet books translated to Vietnamese about cars, trucks and every detail about each part and their maintenance… It had some really good illustrations.

I remember one specific detail. When I grabbed the book and opened it, she leaned towards me, looking at the book, but she leaned with fascination too, we were amazed at the cool illustrations and how old the book was, but at that moment I knew, she definitely trusts me and also likes me.

She sees me as trash right now, but goddamn she is cute, the whole package. fuck me for losing her.

The coffee shop was closing soon (it was 11) and we didn’t want to go home yet… So we decided to go công viên Thống Nhất. But it was late so she wasn’t sure the park will have a place enter and park. But I was certain it had, despite being closed. So we went there, entered no problemo and parked the bike at the entry because we were hesitant to go in the park with the bike. But after walking around, looking for a bench, we went back and took the bike into the park, went around the park 1 time and found a nice bench to sit and talk.

I got to learn about her past, how her mother treats her, her relatives in general, it was nice, the whole vibe.

Suddenly, to spice things up, I decided we should switch to talking in English.

You couldn’t imagine how cute she was speaking English…

I felt a little bit brave for some reason and asked her:

Do you want to hold hands?

She of course didn’t deny, but the way she approached things, with a bit of hesitance, shyness, but still wanting. At the end, she did it, two palms on top of each other, her fingers locked between my fingers… and here we are… It was nice, memorable.

Later she texted me about it, saying that it felt right, it felt like she was holding “the right” person’s hand…

Stayed in that park until 2 in the morning… Slept 3-4 hours and then, wake up and go to work.

### 3. 20.7.2024 The unexpected End of something beautiful…

We met at 3 in the afternoon I think. we couldn’t decide where to go so we went to Hồ Tây to see if there are any interesting places to sit. When I picked her up, I saw she was carrying a bag full of something. (later the contents will be revealed).

During our ride to Hồ Tây, I didn’t pay much attention to the roads, so I accidentally went on to the bridge thinking it was the right way, decided to make an illegal move to get on track, but sneaky traffic cops got me, lost 500k. But I kept it cool, a bit sad and she knew that, but it was fine.

We went around Hồ Tây and she didn’t like any places, Highlands was too crowded, no where was good enough. So we went to a place, “tiny coffee” I think? near the center of Hanoi. Not a bad place, nothing too unique.

The content of her bag: Strawberries with condensed milk, and a type of clay which isn’t exactly for pottery, but we didn’t get to play with it because the vibe went to shit because of a third person… who “joined the chat”

Before starting the next chapter, I would like to mention that we played sudoku, ate some strawberries with condensed milk and so forth. It was nice, it was relaxing, I liked being near her despite not talking much.

# The moment… it all went kaput

# Aftermath

The first day, that is Sunday, 21st was eerily normal? I recorded a video of myself, sharing the disappointment but with a positive note at the end: “we move on” “make some money” “learn and gain some muscle” “travel around Vietnam”

But similar to the Earthquake and the Tsunami in Japan during 2011 - I was post Earthquake, pre Tsunami…

A day later, Monday 22nd, I didn’t go to work that morning, asked for a break in one of the places, but I had one more place where I couldn’t ask for a break. I woke up feeling extremely sad, I was miserable, didn’t know what to do, I slept more, woke up and felt even more miserable… I wanted to talk to her, I wanted to do something… I texted her so much, she doesn’t even care to reply, I think later she blocked me on insta, I found some links, did some OSINT (basically stalking) and found her Facebook profile. She locked her profile because of me later on… On the same day, Monday, my 1 hour work in the afternoon was just, nothing, I couldn’t stop my sadness, I couldn’t stop thinking about her. So I decided, let me get drunk… I want to let the emotions out… Bought myself a authentic 40% Russian Vodka. That shit tastes like absolute shit show. Drank half of it while playing the same song over the headphones “I monster - Who is she”. Got seriously drunk, pushed everyone and everything away, posted some weird frustration shit on FB… Roasted a cringy instagram user. Went on discord and started expressing my frustrations. I was looking for comfort, sympathy, a solution. Some people were nice and understanding, and I my drunk self acknowledged that and appreciated it, but it still didn’t help. I started drinking at 5 in the afternoon and I was sober by 10… I sat in front of the Fridge, I cried a lot. Why? Why did this happen? What did I do? I really miss her. I can’t believe this happened to me, I just can’t… I sobered up, noticed I still had some of that nasty Vodka in me, didn’t vomit shit. I just went and bought a bánh mì, ate it and… went to sleep.

The whole week was absolute shit. I managed to text the person who ruined everything, if she has said anything and here is what I’ve learned: She doesn’t want to talk to me and They (the 2 girls, ex and her) should celebrate the fact that I’m not in their life anymore. Truly the most savage thing I’ve ever heard. She said I had mental issues? personality issues? didn’t exactly elaborate and didn’t want to elaborate so can’t trust her much in that, despite working in psychology.

I got really frustrated at her(not ex). I couldn’t believe she could say such things. I haven’t done anything to her yet now I’m the trash. I’ve made mistakes, yes, but what? can you look beyond that for a second? Seems like you can’t, fast judging and serious misunderstanding and bad conclusions, without a single doubt? Not okay.

I didn’t want her to like me again or something like that. I wanted closure. I wanted a last conversation, in person or through the phone. I texted her multiple times, I want that, please, let’s end it without all that misunderstanding… No she said, no. ” I have no need to talk or listen to you, no desire to do anything with you, you either text here and I might read it or not and might reply or not”. In even more disbelief I find myself… And then of course frustrations… So I expressed them. I texted her I couldn’t believe you are such a savage? You have known my ex for less than an hour and now you celebrate with her? Is that some weird ass feminism shit? Woman power bullshit? You have won and made a man’s life miserable and now let’s be happy cuz he ain’t part of our life anymore?

And then she blocked me… From all sources of contact, done…

### The last attempt.

# What do you think of her?

I like her, a lot, if this isn’t obvious already. I can’t believe she can be such a cold hearted savage, but I can understand that she is sensitive and she definitely didn’t like what she experienced and so, it’s justified.

She is really cute, I think we could have been a great couple, I could have learned a lot from here and I’m sure she can learn a lot from me. She could have been truly The person who could understand me. We could have achieved great things together. And be happy.

I liked our interactions a lot, I can’t ever forget them. The way we talk, the way she reacts, the way she expresses her “unbiased” and “neutral” “centrist” opinion. Her voice can change and she could become childish, and then I tease her and she becomes 23 again… We held hands, we talked, we truly talked, we listened, we ate great food, we went to a great coffee shop. We were very comfortable with each other.

A soulmate some might say… a broken dream is what I say now. A shattered hope. A rose without petals. Life’s continuous shit show.

She has her flaws like me or any other human being, but what does it matter… Seems like she couldn’t accept mine… She couldn’t look beyond that and see the person within…

# What do you think she thinks of you?

She likes my intelligence, she does like me as a person, but she also knows that I have flaws and can be strongly opinionated at times. But now after all that I’m probably just a piece of trash, a case study which she will make fun of with her friends, I see no problems in that, I don’t care what others think. But still. From something beautiful to a piece of trash, in less than an hour…

She thinks we won’t last long, aren’t compatible, that’s some weird conclusions that I don’t believe for a second.

Whatever she thinks now, I can’t do much about it… Wasn’t given a second chance, wasn’t given a chance for closure…

## What if she ACTUALLY DOESN’T like you?

# Are you going to text her back ever?

Yes, her birthday is on the 12th of December. I can’t exactly text her since I’m blocked. But I managed to find some of her Instagram followers, I also found some of her Facebook friends. I think I found her best friend, so on her birthday, I will text her best friend. A long, but hopefully not too long message, long enough to tell her how much she means to me and of course, to wish her happy birthday. Her birthday is 5 months from now… who knows how things are going to be… But despite not feeling sad and hopeless anymore, I still miss her, a lot… and can’t do much about it…

# Do you think she is going to text you back, ever?

She for sure really hates me, or very disappointed or even both… I don’t know because she won’t talk to me. She said “let’s celebrate the fact that “He” isn’t in our life”. Absolutely brutal… So I will assume, she will never want anything to do with me.

# Final thoughts, feelings?

As of writing this, I miss hear dearly. It really shocked my how she ended everything and I can only blame myself for it happening. I could only blame myself that I didn’t stay there and talked her out of her bad mood. I saw the sadness in her face despite she saying “I’m reflecting”. I could have tried my best calm her down. But I was also not feeling alright, I didn’t know what “the kaputeer” texted her, I didn’t know what she was thinking. And so, I just stood up and left, traumatized by the whole experience. I’m not superstitious, I don’t believe in Gods, life is as random as it can get… But I pray one day to see you again, to talk to you again… I will never forget you and the things we did, I will occasionally wonder about you, how are you doing, are you ok… But I can’t ask you…

I’ve read our Instagram chat twice now. And I said that maybe I should made our own app to chat in and I would call it, 2 parrots. Maybe I should actually do that, sounds cool. Why 2 parrots? because parrots mate for life… monogamous and smart, we humans could learn a thing or two from them.

A traumatic tragedy. I can’t find enough power to complete this… The sadness and nostalgia and the tragedy of it all just too heavy. I’m trying to persevere…
