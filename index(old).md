title: Welcome to Vuzinski's Vomit
---
Hello, this small “digital garden” is an expression of myself.

## Why “Vomit”?

Because “myself” includes the **good**, the **bad** and the **ugly**. I’m really tired of judgmental people and so if you are here to understand me, this is a challenge for you to see beyond the good, bad and ugly, to see and understand my intentions, to see me as merely a human, trying to find “the beauty of life”, trying to “make good things happen” despite the absolute bullshit of a life I’ve lived.

Also whatever is written here, shouldn’t be considered valuable at all. I have no reputation, no achievements, I am not to be your source of anything important in your life.

Explore with curiosity. Read for entertainment.

You know when you vomit, you feel a bit better? Well, if I have vomited everything, my head could be lighter, I could cultivate better and healthier thoughts. I would feel better if I can one day look at this and have achieved what I’ve setout to… And so I vomit.

## Why public then?

1. I want to improve my **thinking process**.
2. I want to improve my **writing**.
3. I want to be more **articulate**.

Because I’m noticing that I’m NOT doing those things well, which I don’t like. Because I like to think, and share, and learn. I would like to have no excuses to improve those abilities, so therefore, it being online means I have some responsibility complete things and do things well.

As of now, the tech behind this garden doesn’t support pics and vids. That doesn’t mean its bad, It’s a nice limitation to work around. For feedback, criticism, pictures and videos please scroll to the end of this page and click on the Instagram link.
