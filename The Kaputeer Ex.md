I’m truly sorry for being desperate and so we became a couple in less than 2 weeks of knowing each other. I was lonely for a very long time, I craved proper human interaction… I’m sorry for being a lonely, misfortunate extrovert.

I truly can’t see you as a good human anymore. We talked a lot. No, I told you a lot. We couldn’t talk to each other, we are not mentally compatible, we broke up…

And so when I finally found some worth pursuing you find it and destroy it, despite not being a couple, despite telling you that me and you can’t be compatible.

We went through a lot together for sure, you yourself have experienced a lot because of me. But at the end to ruin it like this and not let it go slowly and maturely, well, I can’t ever see you or anyone even to be trustworthy…

I gifted you a gift, to show my appreciation for everything you have done for me, to use it and enjoy it because you deserved it.

But at the end, when you used that same gift, to ruin my life without even thinking about the consequences… well, I took the gift back…

I will never see you in a good light, we had issues, the reason we lasted is because you are docile.

Congrats and wish you eternal suffering.

Because of you I learned: It’s better to be alone and have no one than to feel alone with the wrong person next to you.

# Someone is defending you

A: “Return it to her if you are a man” B: I don’t care if I’m a man or not, at least hear the whole story and then talk A: “Your behavior is bad” B: It didn’t happen out of nowhere, please, if you don’t understand then I’ll end your relations. A: “sure, you’re scared” B: “a lot” blocked.

I am not to be taught morality by weird people. I don’t ask you to pick my side, I ask you to understand, if you don’t and can’t or don’t care and continue yapping, then its over. You have helped me a lot, I understand and I’m grateful, but don’t tell me what to do because of it. And especially don’t tell me how to be a man, cuz I don’t remember you raising one…
