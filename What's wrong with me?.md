I do hope this doesn't become like one of those previous writings about me scolding myself that I haven't done this and that. I just really find it weird being so into some things but never putting real effort into changing my daily routine. Like, it's always binge watching, thought avoiding daily life. I just wonder what the roots are...
I have a strong feeling its social media, it's the only thing that has been stuck with me since the days I learned about self-development. I learned that from the net too but the habit of browsing the net looking for "something" was also started at the same time. YouTube, Twitch and the other socials.
And so I truly wonder what's up

I think if I'm left long enough without social media, I will just do shit. If I am mindful of what I do on certain social media like YouTube, instead of watching something without any purpose, I should be mindful and always have a reason to watch YouTube. For learning or something like that, and only that.

It's like social media is making me more docile, less human
I'm selling shit, I need to use Facebook, Instagram I should delete and only use 1 time per day, bumble just keep it there too to promote the shit I want to promote and not browse.

It's crazy dude, I'm 25 with so much to learn and do... I had that plan since February this year, it's been 7 months without anything, just looking to interact with people and mindlessly spending money... This is not me getting my act together.
I should be very mindful of when I open an app or something like that. Crazy dude, just crazy.

The will to change starts with awareness and then cultivating mindfulness. 

I should probably do something like delete my social apps on my Samsung and then use them all on the IPhone. And then from there I restrict their usage to like 10 mins per day or something like that and then I can leave the phone here in the house, because it's just social media.
Doesn't sound like a bad idea, I would prefer not having anything at all.
It's good to enter those app with a purpose so now when I'm still developing mindfulness then I should be more careful. I definitely want to write more. To create more and learn more, I wanna just flex it on the socials, I don't want to use socials.
