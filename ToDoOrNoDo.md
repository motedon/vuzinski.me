# IPhone 13 Pro Max 512GB
## Reasons to keep
- Unlocking convenience - FaceID isn't bad at all, reliable and not bothersome.
- Notifications - Always come on time, might be messy but always come on time
- 512GB... Lots of memory to for everything
- Years of Updates to come if new things are added that will be more useful(unknown)
- Camera quality - with that amount of storage - useful.
- General durability - The phone might last longer battery replacement is gonna be expensive but its doable and it will last long, with that storage and IOS updates, I see at least 7 more years.
- Backup secondary phone when the other one fails (hopefully not)
## Reason not to
- Can't block ads, It's gonna be annoying using some apps (games can be played only offline)
- No offline Music
- No movie downloads
- Garbage file manager
- No access to developer stuff (Bluetooth serial)
- Can't make apps for it (no MacOS stuff)
- Not good integration with KDE connect
- CAN'T SIDELOAD APP (trust a company who wants to make profit)
- But still shitty keyboard, no number row.

## What will be it used for?
Camera - recording stuff.
Glorified social media scroll machine.
Note taker? comfortable keyboard to type on
